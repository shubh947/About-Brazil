                    <h2>Wildlife and Amazon Rainforest in Brazil</h2>
                    <p>Amazon Rainforest, large tropical rainforest occupying the drainage basin of the Amazon River and its tributaries in
                    northern South America and covering an area of 2,300,000 square miles (6,000,000 square km). Comprising about 40 percent
                    of Brazil’s total area, it is bounded by the Guiana Highlands to the north, the Andes Mountains to the west, the
                    Brazilian central plateau to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.

                    insects, plants, birds, and other forms of life, many still unrecorded by science. The luxuriant vegetation encompasses
                    a wide variety of trees, including many species of myrtle, laurel, palm, and acacia, as well as rosewood, Brazil nut,
                    and rubber tree. Excellent timber is furnished by the mahogany and the Amazonian cedar. Major wildlife includes jaguar,
